This is example code to control an eFirmata from a webpage.  

Assume that you have the 6 PWMs connected to lights.  Assume that
PWMs 3,4,5 are connected to red, green and blue lights, respectively.  
You can now control the color of the lights.  

(You can even use a jQuery color-picker to choose whatever color you're
in the mood for.  I do.)
