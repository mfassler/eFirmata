<h2>Getting Started Using the mbed</h1>
<h3>mbed with Ethernet</h3>
The easiest way to get started with eFirmata is probably with the mbed, with
an ethernet connection:<br>

<br>
Same pic, with notes:

(You'll have to solder the mbed-ether-kit yourself.)<br>
(I think that the power and ground connection from the ethernet
to the mbed serve as biasing for the magnetics, I'm not sure...<br>
The system will still work without these wires, but auto-negotiation
with the ethernet switch will oftentimes take longer.)

<h3>Serial Debug</h3>
I'm the kind of programmer that does debugging with printf() statements, so
I use a serial port. <br>
Debug-out is on UART#2, pin #28:  <br>

Baud rate:  38400.  8N1.  <br>

<div class="importantNote">
<b>Note:</b> &nbsp; <i> A "proper" PC serial port operates a 12 volts.  The mbed operates at 3.3 volts.</i><br>
The serial adapters that are commonly used in the Arduino world 
(such as <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8772">this one</a>) should work just fine.

<h3>PWM</h3>
The mbed has 6 PWM outputs.  We can use those outputs as light dimmers.  It's
easy to connect these outputs to LEDs:<br>

<br>
From here, you can use the sample code, ( workstation/userFirmataSender.py ), to control
the LEDs.
