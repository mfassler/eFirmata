To build for an ARM processor, we need an ARM cross-compiler.  
The compiler I use is the open-source ARM GCC compiler from 
Code Sourcery.  

At the time of this writing, the latest Free, Open-Source version
seems to be here:

As of June 2013, this seems to be the latest link:

Untar that package and install it to somewhere useful (like /opt).  
Add the bin directory to your $PATH.  I have this in my 
.bash_profile:

PATH=$PATH:/opt/arm-2011.03/bin
export PATH

Installing to mbed:

When you connect your PC to the mbed via USB, the mbed looks like a 
USB drive to the PC.  Simply copy the eFirmata.bin file into that 
USB drive.  (I also delete any other .bin files that are there -- I 
don't know what the mbed does if there are multiple .bin files to 
choose from.)  

After the file is copied, unmount the drive and press the reset 
button on the mbed.  Easy as that.
